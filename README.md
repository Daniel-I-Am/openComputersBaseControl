  //  Program: Base Control
  //  Version: 3.0
  //  By: Daniel_I_Am & Plazter
  //  
  //  GUI Design: Plazter
  //  Original Idea & Execution: Plazter
  //  Recoding and improvements: Daniel_I_Am
  //  
  //  Description:
  //  ============
  //  This program can be used to control all kinds of things in and around you base. You can hook up anything to redstone i/o blocks and add them to a
  //  config file to automatically let it make buttons for you. If you hook up an adapater to a draconic evolution energy storage ball, statistics will
  //  be displayed as well. Even a draconic reactor can be hooked up (requires an adapter to 2 flux gates, in and out, and 1 to a reactor stabilizer).
  //  
  //  Configuration:
  //  ==============
  //  All config files are located in `/usr/config/baseControl/`. There are two files, `main.conf` and `component.conf`. In the main.conf, you must leave the keys intact, the values can be changed. In the component.conf, you can add your components as the format states.
  //  
  //  Installation:
  //  =============
  //  The program can be installed with the following command:
  //  `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Daniel-I-Am/openComputersBaseControl/master/home/baseControl.lua /home/baseControl.lua;baseControl`
  //  This does require an internet connection.
  //  You are then able to start the program with `baseControl` (if located in the home directory). To switch to the home directory, you can just type `cd /home`.
  //  
  //  Updates:
  //  ========
  //  If you want to update the program, you can do so by running the program with the -u option. WARNING: This will reset your configuration, this is done, in case config flags are added/removed/changed. DO NOT COPY IN OLD CONFIG FILES.
